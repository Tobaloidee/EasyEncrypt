EasyEncrypt is a desktop offline application meant to provide encryption and decryption services to users.

we thought of the importance of secrect coded messages amoungst people to avoid sensitive information from being accessed by just anybody.
And so we decided to come up with this project to help people protect sensitive informations from being leaked to the wrong eyes.
Encryption is done with a key chosen by the sender which must be used by the receiver before the encrypted message can be decrypted.

Importance Of EasyEncrypt

It provides security as it is offline and cannot be hacked as such. 
Users can have as much privacy as they want as encrypted text can be sent over social media and mail to directed receiver only without fear of being spied upon.
encrypted text can be encrypted over and over again with different keys and would be decrypted as long as the sequence of encryption and 
the right key attached to each level is followed correctly.
Encryption can now be over one step, so even if your key gets leaked mistakenly, the steps would remain unknown to the key thief, this way security is still assured.
Users can choose between Algorithms to be used (DES, AES).


Enjoy the Encryption and Decryption service rendered by our application.
